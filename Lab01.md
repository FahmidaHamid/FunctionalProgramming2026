# COP 2930: Functional Programming
# Spring 2026
# 02/04/2026 (Day 02, Lab 01)

*********************************************************************************************

### Note: 
	-- We will use Terminal (Mac User) / Command Line Prompts (Windows User) to perform tasks.
	-- Commands are short text instructions you type into a CLI (Command Line Interface) like Windows Command Prompt or macOS/Linux Terminal to perform tasks directly on your system
	-- The lab has two parts: practice and test. You get 20 points each for completing them. 
	-- Submit the practice notes as lab01<LASTNAME>.txt <LASTNAME> should be replaced by your last name. 
	-- The test part is on paper; you will complete the test after submitting the practice part. The test part will be closed book, closed note, no computer; just on paper.

## Practice Sheet

## Basic Comments:

+ To load **GHCi** (latest version of Glassgow Haskell Compiler), type the following on your command prompt:

```
fhamid@NSCHNSXYZ ~ % ghci
```
If the compiler was installed properly, the prompt would show something like the following:

```
GHCi, version 9.6.7: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help

ghci> 

```

+  To quit the ghci, type **:q** on the terminal

```
ghci> :q

Leaving GHCi.

```

+ To clear the screen, type **:! clear ** (for mac/linux) or ** :! cls ** (for windows)

+ To change the prompt to ``cop2930'', type **:set prompt “cop2930> ”**

```

ghci> :set prompt "cop2930>"

cop2930>


```
** note: we changed the prompt just for fun, in case you want to change it to something you like **

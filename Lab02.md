*********************************************************************************************

## Note: 
	-- We will use Terminal (Mac User) / Command Line Prompts (Windows User) to perform tasks.
	-- Commands are short text instructions you type into a CLI (Command Line Interface) like Windows Command Prompt or macOS/Linux Terminal to perform tasks directly on your system
	-- The lab has two parts: practice and test. You get 20 points each for completing them. 
	-- Submit the practice notes as lab02<LASTNAME>.hs <LASTNAME> should be replaced by your last name. 
	-- The test part is on paper; you will complete the test after submitting the practice part. The test part will be closed book, closed note, no computer; just on paper.
